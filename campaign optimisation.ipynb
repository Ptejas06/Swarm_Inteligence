    "## Conclusion:\r\n",
    "The Campaign Optimization Framework (COF), incorporating PSO and campaign rules, provides an effective approach to optimizing the Sphere Function. By leveraging PSO's ability to explore the search space and the intelligent strategies of campaign rules, COF efficiently identifies the global minimum of the objective function. The solution obtained demonstrates the effectiveness of COF in solving complex optimization problems.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In conclusion, the COF presents a promising optimization framework for solving real-world problems across various domains, offering a balance between exploration and exploitation to efficiently converge to optimal solutions. Further research could explore the application of COF to more complex optimization problems and its scalability to larger search spaces."

    "In the implementations provided for both marketing campaign optimization and social media campaign optimization, we have used a simplified version of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as the swarm intelligence-based algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based stochastic optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. In PSO, a group of particles (representing potential solutions) move through the search space, each adjusting its position based on its own experience and the experience of neighboring particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the implementations don't include the full PSO algorithm with velocity updates and neighborhood interactions, they follow the general principles of swarm intelligence. The particles (representing candidate solutions) are iteratively updated based on their performance (objective function evaluation) and the application of campaign rules (CCR and ICR), mimicking the exploration and exploitation behavior of a swarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, even though it's a simplified version, the approach still leverages the principles of swarm intelligence, particularly inspired by PSO, to optimize the campaign strategies iteratively."
